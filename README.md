# CS-583-MS-Apriori-Algorithm
MSApriori is an algorithm for mining frequent itemsets by using multiple minimum supports. It is a generalization of the Apriori algorithm, which uses a single minimum support threshold.  The idea behind MSApriori is that different minimum supports could be used to consider the fact that some items are less frequent than others in a dataset.It is also based on levelwise search. It generates all large itemsets by making multiple passes over the data. In the first pass, it counts the supports of individual items and determines whether they are large. In each subsequent pass, it starts with the seed set of itemsets found to be large in the previous pass. It uses this seed set to generate new possibly large itemsets, called candidate itemsets. The actual supports for these candidate itemsets are computed during the pass over the data. At the end of the pass, it determines which of the candidate itemsets are actually large.
